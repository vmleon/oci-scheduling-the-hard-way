## Create the virtual machine to be scheduled

> For testing, use the smallest shape possible to play around

Take note of the compartment `OCID` the instance is being created in.

> You can find compartments and the `OCID` on `Menu > Identity > Compartments` on the Oracle Cloud web console.

Let's call the machine `scheduled`.

## Get familiar with OCI Command Line Interface

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cloudshellintro.htm) is a web browser-based terminal accessible from the Oracle Cloud Console.

Cloud Shell is free to use, and provides access to a Linux shell, with a pre-authenticated Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI, a pre-authenticated Ansible installation, and other useful tools for following Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service tutorials and labs.

Cloud Shell is a feature available to all OCI users, accessible from the Console.

Your Cloud Shell will appear in the Oracle Cloud Console as a persistent frame of the Console, and will stay active as you navigate to different pages of the Console.

Create a VM that we are going to use for testing the scheduling.

Open `Cloud Shell` and wait for the instantiation:

![Cloud Shell Icon](images/cloud_shell_icon.png)

Export a variable `C` with the compartment OCID value:

```bash
export C=<compartment_OCID>
```

List your instances in the compartment and filter relevant information with `jq`:

```bash
oci compute instance list -c $C | jq '.data[] | {ocid: .id, name: ."display-name", status: ."lifecycle-state"}'
```

Export variable `INSTANCE_ID` with instance OCID:

```bash
export INSTANCE_ID=<instance_ocid>
```

Ask the instance to stop, nicely:

```bash
oci compute instance action --action SOFTSTOP --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID
```

As part of scripting for DevOps, it is nice if we wait for the action to be performed.

To Start the instance and wait for the action to be completed:

```bash
oci compute instance action --action START --wait-for-state RUNNING --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID
```

## Create the VM to schedule resources

Once again, create a new virtual machine. This time we are going to call it `scheduler`.

> Pick the smallest shape as the workload is going to be minimal

SSH into the machine

```bash
ssh opc@<public_ip>
```

Install the OCI CLI (Oracle Linux 8)

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/oci-cli/master/scripts/install/install.sh)"
```

> For other versions and more info, visit [OCI CLI installation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm)

Select all the default values, press [ENTER] to do so.

Confirm everything works by printing the version of the CLI tool

```bash
oci -v
```

### Configure OCI CLI

You can follow the steps in [Setting up the Config File](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm#configfile)

```bash
oci setup config
```

> To retrieve the values [Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five)

Press `ENTER` on `Enter a location for your config [/home/opc/.oci/config]:`

Set the User `OCID` on `Enter a user OCID:`

Set the Tenancy `OCID` on `Enter a tenancy OCID:`

Set the Region `name` on `Enter a region (e.g. ...`. I use `uk-london-1` but pick yours.

Answer `Y` to `Do you want to generate a new API Signing RSA key pair? (If you decline you will be asked to supply the path to an existing key.) [Y/n]:`

Press `ENTER` on `Enter a directory for your keys to be created [/home/opc/.oci]:`

Press `ENTER` on `Enter a name for your key [oci_api_key]:`

Press `ENTER` on `Enter a passphrase for your private key (empty for no passphrase):`

There will print the configuration path, fingerprint and keys path:

```
Public key written to: /home/opc/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
Enter a passphrase for your private key (empty for no passphrase):
Private key written to: /home/opc/.oci/oci_api_key.pem
Fingerprint: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99
Config written to /home/opc/.oci/config
```

Get the content of your public key:

> Copy all the content, make sure you don't copy any ghost character

```bash
cat /home/opc/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
```

Copy the public key and go to your Oracle Cloud user settings on `Menu > Identity > Users > <your_user>`.

Then in the small menu on the bottom-left on `API Keys`

Click Add Public Key and `PASTE PUBLIC KEYS`, then paste the content of your public key

Confirm the fingerprint match the one created with `oci setup keys`.

Come back to the SSH terminal and confirm by requesting the namespace of Object Storage service:

```bash
oci os ns get
```

You should get a response in JSON format.

### Scheduling with cron

Create a bash script for starting the resource:

```bash
vim start_instance.sh
```

With the following script"

```bash
#!/bin/bash
INSTANCE_ID=<ocid_of_your_instance>
echo "Starting instance..."
oci compute instance action --action START --wait-for-state RUNNING --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID
```

Create a bash script for stopping the resource:

```bash
vim stop_instance.sh
```

With the following script"

```bash
#!/bin/bash
INSTANCE_ID=<ocid_of_your_instance>
echo "Stopping instance..."
oci compute instance action --action SOFTSTOP --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID
```

```bash
chmod u+x start_instance.sh
```

```bash
chmod u+x stop_instance.sh
```

Create a `cron` tab for the schedule time.

```bash
crontab -e
```

```bash
PATH=/home/opc/bin:$PATH
0,20,40 * * * * /home/opc/stop_instance.sh >> /home/opc/stop.log 2>&1
10,30,50 * * * * /home/opc/start_instance.sh >> /home/opc/start.log 2>&1
```

> Remember to change the paths if you use other user or Linux distribution

Schedule a cron to execute on every 10 minutes
List the crontab

```bash
crontab -l
```

After the scheduling happens you can see the logs of `cron` by reading `/var/log/cron`.

```bash
tail /var/log/cron
```

> You might need sudo to have access to `var/log/cron`

You should see something like this after half an hour or so:

```
Sep 30 11:20:01 scheduler CROND[15369]: (opc) CMD (/bin/sh stop_instance.sh)
Sep 30 11:30:01 scheduler CROND[17576]: (opc) CMD (/bin/sh start_instance.sh)
Sep 30 11:40:01 scheduler CROND[19820]: (opc) CMD (/bin/sh stop_instance.sh)
```

You will also have `start.log` and `stop.log` log files on `/home/opc`.

### Useful crontab entries

Execute at 2am daily

`0 2 * * * /home/user/job.sh`

Execute twice a day

`0 4,16 * * * /home/user/job.sh`

Execute on every minute

`* * * * * /home/user/job.sh`

Execute on every Sunday at 10 PM

`0 22 * * sun /home/user/job.sh`

Execute on every 10 minutes

`*/10 * * * * /home/user/job.sh`

## Watch out

This is just a simple example to make you familiar with OCI, in a production environment you should look out for:

- **High Availability**, what happens when the `scheduler` fail?
- **Observability**, do I know if the `scheduler` fails to perform an action?
- Don't use public IPs directly with SSH, better to use a **bastion host**
- Configure `oci` with a user that only have **permissions** to work on a compartment and do the actions that you need
